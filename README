NOTE: This library is still alpha and can change in unpredictable ways in the future.

This library can now be built with Maven. Install Maven 2 or better, then type
"mvn package" in this directory. You will find the resulting .jar in the
/target directory after the build.

See https://gist.github.com/1246816 for an example.
